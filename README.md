## Abstract:
This is a very short summary of the Biblatex package. It will provide quick and easy reference to compile a bibliography while writing scientific articles and manuscripts using LATEX. I summarized all required and optional fields for each standard bibliographic category listed in the manual. Soon, I will be adding a natbib package.

##Introduction:
Citing and reference is most crucial part in academic writing. Latex is very handy when its comes with organizing reference and citing articles with biblatex and natbib package. However, reading long manuals to figure out essential parts to include while referencing papers is time consuming. This file summarize all essential information necessary to cite all types of standard references available in biblatex package. I will expand this file later by adding natbib package.

## How to use?
I am summarizing biblatex and natbib packages. Items are arranged in alphabetical orders–following ordering in original documents–and grouped by packages making items easier to find. You can also click “Cltr+ F” in window or “Command + F”in mac and search using keywords to find each items in this pdf quickly. I will list essential and optional elements by separating them with single line space. This file allow you to copy the code and use without adding additional code to work properly. Copying formats in this document is also easy. You can simply highlight code that you need and copy by clicking “Ctrl + C” in Windows or “Command + C” in Mac.

## What are not included?
I compiled most commonly used standard referencing materials covering small fraction of 357 pages manual. Several non-standard referencing materials such as artwork, audio, bibnote, commetry, image, jurisdiction, legislation, legal, letter, movie, music etc. are excluded. Further the definitions of unfamiliar fields like eid, eprint, addeemdum, version, note, etc were also excluded.
