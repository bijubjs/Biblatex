## Abstract:
This is a very short summary of the Biblatex package. It will provide quick and easy reference to compile a bibliography while writing scientific articles and manuscripts using LATEX. I summarized all required and optional fields for each standard bibliographic category listed in the manual. Soon, I will be adding a natbib package.

##Introduction:
Citing and reference is most crucial part in academic writing. Latex is very handy when its comes with organizing reference and citing articles with biblatex and natbib package. However, reading long manuals to figure out essential parts to include while referencing papers is time consuming. This file summarize all essential information necessary to cite all types of standard references available in biblatex package. I will expand this file later by adding natbib package.

## How to use?
I am summarizing biblatex and natbib packages. Items are arranged in alphabetical orders–following ordering in original documents–and grouped by packages making items easier to find. You can also click “Cltr+ F” in window or “Command + F”in mac and search using keywords to find each items in this pdf quickly. I will list essential and optional elements by separating them with single line space. This file allow you to copy the code and use without adding additional code to work properly. Copying formats in this document is also easy. You can simply highlight code that you need and copy by clicking “Ctrl + C” in Windows or “Command + C”in Mac. You may see page numbers included if codes are spread in multiple pages–just delete the page number copied with code. If your author is institutional author you must do “author = {{Name of Organizational Author}}”for full name of organizational to appear in the citation. 

## What are not included?
I compiled most commonly used standard referencing materials covering small fraction of 357 pages manual. Several non-standard referencing materials such as artwork, audio, bibnote, commetry, image, jurisdiction, legislation, legal, letter, movie, music etc. are excluded. Further the definitions of unfamiliar fields like eid, eprint, addeemdum, version, note, etc were also excluded.

## Disclaimer
All contents in this document are taken from 357 page long the biblatex package manual. Author only compiled essential parts of the manuals. Read original manual for detailed instructions, excluded items, guidelines, accuracy, and copyright information.
