## Introdution:
This is a very short summary of the Biblatex package. It will provide quick and easy reference to compile a bibliography while writing scientific articles and manuscripts using LATEX. I summarized all required and optional fields for each standard bibliographic category listed in the manual. Soon, I will be adding a natbib package.
